    <h1>NOW 'TIS TIME TO DON THE SORTING HAT...</h1>

    <p><em>You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart,
    <br>Their daring, nerve and chivalry, set Gryffindors apart;
    <br>You might belong in Hufflepuff where they are just and loyal,
    <br>Those patient Hufflepuffs are true, and unafraid of toil;
    <br>Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you've a ready mind,
    <br>Where those of wit and learning, will always find their kind;
    <br>Or perhaps in Slytherin, you'll make your real friends,
    <br>Those cunning folk use any means, to achieve their ends.</em></p>
